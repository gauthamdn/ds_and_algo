/*200. Number of Islands

Companies

Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.


Example 1:
Input: grid = [
  ['1','1','1','1','0'],
  ['1','1','0','1','0'],
  ['1','1','0','0','0'],
  ['0','0','0','0','0']
]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: grid = [
  ['1','1','0','0','0'],
  ['1','1','0','0','0'],
  ['0','0','1','0','0'],
  ['0','0','0','1','1']
]
Output: 3

Constraints:

    m == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 300
    grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

// approach 
// this is very similar to graph problem of finding the num of provinces 
// Similar to that provinces we have to go visit all node and find out if its surrounded/connected or not
// to check connected , we need to traverse the 4 directions( up, down, left , right )
// assume in a matrix (r,c) indicates a node of the matrix ( here r is row, c is column of a matrix )
// then to traverse left (r-1, c) , to right ( r+1, c) , to up (r,c-1) to down (r, c+1 )
// basically if you take any node - you can add the following [( -1,0) , (+1,0) , (0,-1), (0,+1)] to traverse the 4 directions.
// basically you have to do dfs 4 times in the 4 directions and keep marking visited and increment the island result counter.
